    hi mom, here's a little project i made. not to like impress you enough into 
    forgiveness, but to be as genuine as i can be for both 
    an apology and a need for understanding without a real world talk.

dear mom, <br>

i’m genuinely so sorry for what i did last 09/24/2024. 
i was more on overwhelmed with how i felt and i’m not someone 
who likes being alone with my thoughts as it is very damaging to me as an 
adolescent who’s still trying to navigate through her “golden” years, so i 
went out of the car. i do not wish for you to hate me because of a misunderstanding,
 so i’m gonna explain. it’s okay if you’ll still be mad after this, 
i just don’t want you to be mad at me for the wrong reasons, so this is how i’ll 
perceive it. <br>
<br>
imagine a conflagration--endless and brutal flames spreading all over,
 and no matter what you do, millions of buckets can’t do a thing to perpetrate or extinguish it. 
 you eventually nearly get overwhelmed by this fire, everything else potentially of 
 help just adding to the damage. naturally, what would you do? would you scream or search for help, or would you be one to accept your fate and perish into the burn? <br>
i don’t mean to be offensive, but you would know how it felt to desperately need help, 
and that’s exactly what i acted upon. i ran away that day not because i wanted to see
 people for fun, but because i didn’t feel like i could keep going. going to school 
 and living my life as me with people who made me feel safe enough to express myself 
 kept away the bad thoughts. that’s why i had a tendency to get so attached to the 
 friend group i don’t really have anymore.

    i want to make this clear. i don’t have a victim complex,
	and i don’t pretend or act or think like i know everything. i build up every 
	ounce of me up and i crush it down whenever i think i’m too much, and i hate how 
	the words choke up in my throat whenever i want to say something deep or to tell 
	you that your assumptions are wrong. and this isn’t me asking for your pity. i just
	want to clarify and speak up while i can. <br>
<br>
mom, i’m 14. i know very well where i stand and i know you’re gonna make it seem like
 i’m demanding for it when i’m literally saying all this to make sure you know i’m very 
 much not, but i need respect, too. i’m human as well. my feelings aren’t overdramatic 
 to me as i’m still young and incredibly naïve, but i don’t want to feel like they’re 
 extremely invalid as well. i’m not talking about the 
 ‘listen-to-me-cuz-i’m-superior-or-above-you’ kind of respect. the kind of respect
 where i’m acknowledged as someone who has feelings and as someone who’s still trying 
 to grow. i’m not saying that should justify all of my wrongdoings, but it does explain
 a lot as to why i seem so “inconsiderate” even though i’m not actually that greedy at 
 all.
